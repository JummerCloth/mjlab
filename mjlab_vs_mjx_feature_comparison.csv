SUMMARY - Migration Work Required:
Critical (Must Have):
1. Frame stacking implementation for observations
2. Convert Gin configs to mjlab dataclass configs
3. Port specialized environments if needed
4. Convert motion file formats (LZ4 to NPZ)

Important (Should Have):
1. Action delay mechanism
2. Advanced IMU noise models (AR(1), bias random walks)
3. Motion selection curriculum
4. DeepMimic-specific reward functions
5. Phase signal for periodic motions

Optional (Nice to Have):
1. Recurrent policy networks
2. Symmetry augmentation/mirror loss
3. ZMP walking reference generator
4. Site-based tracking
5. More specialized environments

Notes:
- mjlab uses PyTorch instead of JAX (different paradigm)
- Configuration system is fundamentally different (dataclass vs Gin)
- mjlab is more modular and cleaner but missing some specialized features
- Core training infrastructure is equivalent or better in mjlab
- Most RL fundamentals are present and well-implemented
